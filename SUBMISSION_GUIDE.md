# Kaggle MedGemma Impact Challenge: Submission Guide

## Project: DailyHealth AI MedGemma
This application is a specialized health ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between clinical medical data and daily lifestyle decisions. It uses a **Multi-Agent Architecture** where specialized AI personas (Dietitian, Trainer, Counselor, Sleep Specialist) collaborate under a **Lead Coordinator**.

### 1. Core Integration: MedGemma Medical Agent
The heart of this submission is the **Medical Specialist Agent**, which leverages the **MedGemma** open-weights model for advanced clinical reasoning.

- **Role:** The Medical Agent acts as the clinical "safety check" for the entire ecosystem.
- **Functions:**
    - **Clinical Q&A:** Answers user health concerns based on their specific medical history and genetic risks.
    - **Document Analysis:** Parses complex medical test results (e.g., blood panels) to extract key findings for the user's longitudinal record.
    - **Cross-Agent Verification:** During the "Daily Consensus Meeting," the Medical Agent (powered by MedGemma) reviews the logs from the Dietitian and Trainer to identify potential contraindications (e.g., advising against high-intensity cardio if a heart condition is detected in the user's history).

### 2. Architecture & Hosting
This project demonstrates a hybrid cloud architecture suitable for healthcare applications:
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript) hosted via Google AI Studio / Firebase.
- **General Reasoning:** Gemini 3.1 Flash/Pro models handle non-clinical tasks (meal analysis, workout generation, emotional support).
- **Clinical Reasoning:** A dedicated **MedGemma** instance handles sensitive medical data. The code is designed to connect to a MedGemma weights instance hosted on **Vertex AI Model Garden** or a **Kaggle Notebook** endpoint.

### 3. Impact of MedGemma
By using MedGemma instead of a general-purpose LLM, this application provides:
- **Clinical Specificity:** MedGemma's fine-tuning on medical datasets allows for more precise interpretation of medical terminology and risk factors.
- **Privacy Readiness:** As an open-weights model, MedGemma can be deployed in HIPAA-compliant private environments, ensuring that sensitive medical history never leaves the user's controlled infrastructure.

### 4. How to Verify the Medical Logic
1.  Navigate to the **Medical** tab in the application.
2.  Upload a medical document image or describe a symptom (e.g., "I have consistent lower back pain and a history of scoliosis").
3.  Observe the clinical-style response generated by the MedGemma integration.
4.  Run the **Daily Board Meeting** on the Dashboard to see how MedGemma's insights are synthesized into a holistic daily plan.
